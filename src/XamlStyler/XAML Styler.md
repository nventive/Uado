# XAML Styler

This project is using XAML Styler to have consistent XAML formatting.

We recommend installing the visual studio extension for best results. The formatting will happen on save via this extension.

[settings.xamlstyler configuration file](..\settings.xamlstyler) contains all the configurations, see it as an .editorconfig equivalent for XAML.

You can run the powershell script (.ps1) to run it via the console on all files. It is important to do this if you change something in the config!

You can read the [extension's documentation](https://github.com/Xavalon/XamlStyler/wiki)
